The dataset used in the following paper for multiview segmentation evaluations:
"SPIn-NeRF: Multiview Segmentation and Perceptual Inpainting with Neural Radiance Fields"

Please visit our website for additional information about SPIn-NeRF:

We provide the openly available part of the dataset used in our multiview segmentation evaluations. Each folder contains annotations for a scene. The name of each folder contains the name of the scene, as well as the name of the dataset each scene is taken from (if available). Here are the links to the original images from each of the datasets:
